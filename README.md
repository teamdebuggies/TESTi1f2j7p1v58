      ## Rationale
      # Architecture Rationale

## Chosen Cloud-Native Patterns and Components
1. **Microservices Architecture**: The monolithic application will be decomposed into microservices for better scalability, resilience, and ease of deployment.
2. **Containerization**: Leveraging Docker containers for microservices to ensure consistent environments and seamless deployment.
3. **API Gateway**: To expose services to users and manage traffic efficiently.
4. **Serverless Functions**: For handling event-driven and background tasks, such as transaction notifications.

## Technology Decisions and Justification
- **AWS**: Chosen for its robust infrastructure, extensive services, and compliance capabilities in the finance sector.
- **Amazon RDS**: To handle relational data management easily with automated backups and scaling.
- **Amazon S3**: For cost-effective and scalable storage of performance reports and logs.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Provides observability and real-time monitoring capabilities.

## Benefits
- **Scalability**: Microservices can scale independently based on load, enhancing performance during peak hours.
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay-as-you-go model reduces infrastructure costs compared to on-premises.
- **Security**: Improved security with IAM roles, VPC isolation, and managed identity services that adhere to regulatory standards.
- **Resilience**: Built-in redundancy and failover capabilities in AWS enhance application reliability.
- **Faster Feature Delivery**: CI/CD pipelines enable rapid deployment of new features, boosting customer satisfaction.

## Alignment with Industry Context
This architecture aligns with the financial services industry's need for compliance, scalability, and rapid feature delivery, enabling the organization to maintain competitiveness.

      ## Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
      # Architectural Decision Record

## Problem(s) to Solve
- The legacy application faces performance issues and lacks scalability, operational monitoring, and modern observability features.
- Integration with new technologies is limited due to the monolithic design.

## Analysis Performed
- Evaluated the challenges of maintaining a monolithic COBOL application against contemporary cloud-native architecture benefits.
- Assessed AWS capabilities in terms of compliance standards, cost-effectiveness, and scaling.

## Decision and Justification
- Transitioning to a microservices-based architecture hosted on AWS, utilizing containerization and serverless functions is recommended. This decision is based on the need for scalability, reduced operational risks, improved maintainability, and enhanced observability features that AWS provides.
